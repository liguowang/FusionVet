Introduction
====================
Gene fusion is a common type of somatic alterations that plays an important role in
tumorgenesis. Well-known examples include the intra-chromosomal TMPRSS2-ERG fusions
in prostate cancer, and the inter-chromosomal BCR-ABL fusions in chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML). Next generation sequencing technologies especially RNA-seq enables
the genome-wide detection of gene fusions with high sensitivity. To date, most recurrent
gene fusions in common cancers have been identified and various gene fusion databases have been 
built:
 * `COSMIC <https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/fusion>`_
 * `FusionGDB <https://ccsm.uth.edu/FusionGDB>`_
 * `FusionHub <https://fusionhub.persistent.co.in>`_ 
 * `ChimerDB <http://203.255.191.229:8080/chimerdbv31/mhelp.cdb>`_
